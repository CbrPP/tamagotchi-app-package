# Tamagotchi Life Coach - User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to Tamagotchi Life Coach, a next-generation virtual pet app that goes beyond traditional Tamagotchi experiences. This app combines the nostalgic care mechanics of virtual pets with modern features like lifestyle integration, AI interaction, and a breeding marketplace.

Your Tamagotchi isn't just a digital pet - it's a life coach that mirrors your habits, evolves based on your lifestyle, and helps you become the best version of yourself.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your Tamagotchi

1. Sign up for an account
2. Choose your starter egg
3. Name your Tamagotchi

Your Tamagotchi starts as a simple egg that will hatch into a basic form. How you care for it from this point forward will determine its evolution path and personality development.

## Core Features

- Recent activity log
- Evolution progress

Your Tamagotchi will float on your screen, displaying different emotions and animations based on its current state.
